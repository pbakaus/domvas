# Domvas

## Overview

__Domvas implements the missing piece that connects the DOM and Canvas__. It gives to the ability to take arbitrary DOM content and paint it to a Canvas of your choice.

## Usage

	var canvas = document.getElementById("test");
	var context = canvas.getContext('2d');

	domvas.toImage(document.getElementById("dom"), function() {
  	context.drawImage(this, 20, 20);
	});
	
## Syntax

	domvas.toImage(domElement, readyCallback, width, height, left, top);	
readyCallback's 'this' and first argument points to a valid, preloaded image node that you can simply draw to your canvas context.

## How it works

Domvas uses a feature of SVG that allows you to embed XHTML content into the SVG – and as you might know, the actual SVG can be used as a data uri, and therefore behaves like a standard image.

I have written about this technique in 2008 [when I brought CSS transforms to browsers that did not have them](http://paulbakaus.com/2008/08/19/css-transforms-for-firefox/). It took a little more experimentation to transform it into a reusable plugin: HTML content needs to be serialized to XML, and all styles have to be inlined.	

## Caveats

- __Internet Explorer is not supported__, as it doesn't support the foreignObject tag in SVG.
- For whatever reason, Opera is failing. I am not sure why. If a Opera pal is reading this, get in touch!
- SVG's foreignObject is subject to strong security – meaning any external content will likely fail (i.e. iframes, web fonts)
- The DOM object is __not linked, but copied__ – if you change the style of the DOM object, it will not automatically update in Canvas
- Content outside the bounding box of the element will be cut of per default if painted to Canvas. Don't worry though, simply pass a more comfortable offset to the toImage function (see above)
